            Helping Hands is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving those most at-risk to COVID-19: 
            Senior citizens, the immune compromised, and people with pre-existing medical conditions which 
            Put them at additional risk.<br />
             Our community volunteers and delivery partners deliver groceries, medicine, and other necessary 
            Supplies to empower everyone to stay healthy and be as responsible as they can be.<br /><br />
