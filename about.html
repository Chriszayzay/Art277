        <h2>Mission</h2>
        

      <p2> Our mission is to serve individuals at risk for COVID-19 and food insecurity, using technology to<br /> 

      empower community organizations and local volunteers to deliver the essential supplies to those in 

      Need.</p2><br />

    <h2>How we help</h2>

   <p2> Lemme Help connects those who must shelter in place with our volunteers and delivery partners so 
    
    Groceries, medication and essential supplies get delivered safely.
    Our technology platform makes<br /><br />
    <img src="man.jpg" alt="man" />
Community volunteerism easy and reliable while providing an intuitive 

Solution for partners to scale their own impact.<br /><br />

Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch 

Requests at scale through the Lemme Help platform, while we connect 

Individuals who need help and can offer help through our website.<br /><br />

Our partnerships with organizations like Wider Circle, Optum, Second 

Harvest, Uber and others have allowed us to help bridge volunteer 

Shortages and solve the challenge of last mile delivery at scale. We’ve 

Grown the number of people we can help by working together—and we 

Are always open to new partners who want to contribute to our mission.</p2><br /><br />

    <h2>Join our team</h2>

<p2>Founded by veterans of Uber, Facebook, and Google, as well as students beginning their careers, the 

Lemme Help organization comprises more than 150 volunteers around the country who want to give 

Back. Together, we make local volunteerism easy and reliable for our partners and help to slow the 

National spread of COVID-19.<br /><br />

If you are passionate about making a difference in people’s lives, we’d love to have you join our team of 

Dedicated volunteers!</p2><br /><br />
